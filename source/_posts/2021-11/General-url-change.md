I lost my cloudflare and namecheap account after i reset my yubikey's fido applet because macos gpg tools was being extremely bad at handling 
ssh fido keys and gpg, resulting in my yubikey not being usable as a smartcard in macos, which was the only os i had access to 
(found out about t2linux much MUCH later). i had to ssh into multiple servers and my key was the only option. fuck you apple.

anyways, i bought a new domain after the kcomain.dev domain was about to expire coincidentally (like a week earlier). it is this domain, soopy.moe.
i don't control the kcomain.dev domain anymore, please do not send any more emails to that address because i will not be reading them (improvmx only
allows 1 domain at a time and setting it up is a major chore)

haven't got the time to setup all the old stuff back to my current domain (tbh most of the old stuff are not working anyways so you shouldn't need to care)

a list of my currently open services can be found [here](https://soopy.moe/stack)
