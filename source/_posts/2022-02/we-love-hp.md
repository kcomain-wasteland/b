sometimes linux just doesn't work and you have a hard time finding why. this happened to my friend today because their 
pc doesn't work well with linux. it took them like 3 days before figuring out a possible solution. 

their problem was every single distro shows a black screen and nothing else. They tried Ubuntu, Endeavour and Manjaro
and all gave them the black screen treatment.

Solution: add `noapic` to kernel command line.
