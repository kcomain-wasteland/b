This time, OpenSSH decided to add a key-exchangealgorithm that just so happens to break my GPG+YubiKey ssh setup. Said kex algorithm is sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com. If you don‚Äôt removeit, any attempts to connect to the server with the ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù yubikey (I have a5.2.7 yubikey) will result in the scdaemon spitting a not-at-all helpful errormessage at you: 1gpg-agent[1074]: scdaemon[1074]: app_auth failed: Invalid value This was a bit confusing and took me a while to figure out why it happens^2, evenwith gpg-agent set to output all information possible. Solution^1: 12# /etc/ssh/sshd_config+ KexAlgorithms -sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com It‚Äôs worth noting that this config only applies to sshd. If you‚Äôre a client tryingto connect to a remote server that doesn‚Äôt have this, it will not work.
